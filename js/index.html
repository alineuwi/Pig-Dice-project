                <p id="oneDie">Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player
                    decides to
                    "bank". If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the
                    player
                    rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a
                    player chooses
                    to "bank", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. <br><br>The
                    first
                    player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
                <p id="twoDice">This variation is the same as Pig except two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows
                    a 1,
                    their sum is added to the turn total. If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the
                    turn ends.
                    If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.<br><br>The first player
                    to score
                    100 or more points wins.</p>
